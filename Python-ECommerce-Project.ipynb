    "# Project: E-Commerce Management System\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The E-Commerce Management System project aims to develop a comprehensive solution for managing an online retail platform. The system will facilitate the management of products, customers, orders, and sales reports, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface for users to interact with the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objectives of the E-Commerce Management System project are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Product Management:** Create a system to add and manage product details, including product name, price, and quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Customer Management:** Implement functionality to add and manage customer profiles, including customer name and email.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Order Processing:** Develop a cart-based order processing mechanism that allows customers to add products to their cart, process orders, and update product quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sales Reporting:** Generate sales reports that summarize total revenue and identify the most popular products based on order history.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **User Interface:** Build a user interface that enables users to interact with the system through a command-line interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functional Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Product Management\n",
    "\n",
    "- Users can add new products to the system by providing product details (name, price, quantity).\n",
    "- Users can view and update the quantity of existing products.\n",
    "- Users can display detailed information about a specific product.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Customer Management\n",
    "\n",
    "- Users can add new customers to the system by providing customer details (name, email).\n",
    "- Users can view customer profiles, including name, email, and order history.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Order Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Users can add products to a customer's cart for processing.\n",
    "- Users can process orders by checking out the items in the cart, updating product quantities, and adding the order to the customer's order history.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Sales Reporting\n",
    "\n",
    "- Users can generate sales reports that display total revenue.\n",
    "- The system identifies and displays the most popular products based on the number of orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. User Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "- Users interact with the system through a command-line interface.\n",
    "- The interface provides a menu with options for product management, customer management, order processing, sales reporting, and system exit.\n",
    "- Users receive prompts and instructions for each action they take within the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Non-Functional Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- The system should handle errors gracefully and provide clear error messages to users.\n",
    "- Data should be stored in text files for persistence across sessions.\n",
    "- The user interface should be intuitive and user-friendly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "The E-Commerce Management System project will deliver the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python code implementing the core functionalities of the system.\n",
    "2. A command-line user interface for interacting with the system.\n",
    "3. Sales reports that summarize revenue and popular products.\n",
    "4. Documentation explaining the project, including the problem statement, functionality, and instructions for use.\n"
